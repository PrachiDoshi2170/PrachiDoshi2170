My current coursework includes Introduction to Information Security, wherein we study various domains of security such as Cryptography, Web Security, Network Security, TOR, Blockchain security while solving CTF challenges as a part of our homework. I am also studying Applied Infromation Assurance, wherein I get to learn about various security tools such as SharpHound, Mimikatz, Suricata, Splunk, Kibana, pfsense, Arkime etc. We are also creating a lab portal to demostrate the importance of POdman over Docker in Linux Enviroment. I am also taking Cyber risk modeling, where in I am learning various frameworks an organization has to refer to and apply to mitigate the existing security gaps and ensure better data security in future
